**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************
Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g., Ipopt-3.3.1),
create the build directory and use the script to configure Ipopt

   ./ipopt_static for static version
   or
   ./ipopt_setup for dynamic version

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).

Afterwards, you need to update paths in following makefiles

   Ipopt/examples/ScalableProblems/Makefile.in:
   MKLROOT=/apps/intel/17.0.0/mkl
   OPENMPI_DIR=/home/kardos/privateapps/openmpi/2.0.1
   SCHUR_DIR=/home/kardos/PowerGrid

   Ipopt/src/Algorithm/LinearSolvers/Makefile.in:
   SCHUR_INCLUDE=/home/kardos/PowerGrid/include
   OPENMPI_DIR=/home/kardos/privateapps/openmpi/2.0.1
   
   Ipopt/src/Algorithm/Makefile.in:
   SCHUR_INCLUDE=/home/kardos/PowerGrid/include
   MPI_INCLUDE=/home/kardos/privateapps/openmpi/2.0.1

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Ipopt successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make -j4

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the subdirectory

   cd Ipopt/examples/ScalableProblems

First, set up the proper environment by loading proper modulefiles (i.e. ICS-MASTER machine):
  1) use.own        2) intel/17.0.0   3) gcc/6.1.0

and then build the example by typing 

   make

and to run the example use the run.sh script, for example

   ./run.sh 2 10 2 schur     run 2 MPI processes using Schur solver (N>1 always)
   ./run.sh 1 10 2 pardiso   run !!single!! process with Pardiso (N=1 always)
